//! Project / Folder creation-binding authority.
//!
//! `tjuaeui-project` is the single authority for the consistency of the three
//! project-bind tables (`projects` / `folders` / `project_explorer`) and for
//! resource identity + containment. It holds only logic: SQL and transactions
//! live in `tjuaeui-db` behind `IProjectStore`, injected as `Arc<dyn IProjectStore>`.
//!
//! Two pure modules ([`canonical`], [`containment`]) are safety/correctness
//! critical and filesystem-free; the rest is service orchestration.
